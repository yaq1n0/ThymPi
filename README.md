# Setup Guide: 

This setup guide isn't step by step but instead a rough guide to help you get started 
as a lot of the installation process is highly dependent on the platform you intend to run this on. 

**For reference, this is the development environment I used**
<br>Computer: Raspberry Pi 3B+ 
<br>Operating System: Raspberry Pi OS (legacy) 
<br>_note: this is the debian 10 (buster) based version_

**MPU6050 Setup** 
<br>The installation process for this is very simple, simply follow the instructions in the repository
<br>Repository: https://github.com/m-rtijn/mpu6050
